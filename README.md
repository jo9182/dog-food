# Dog feeding tracker
Answers the question of "Did anyone feed the dog yet?"

A sensor detects when the door to the dog food container is opened/closed and colors the LED to indicate when the dog was fed last:
* ðŸŸ¢ Green indicates that the dog has been fed her breakfast / dinner (or at least that the food has been opened within the last 8 hours)
* ðŸ”´ Red indicates the dog has not been fed her current meal
* ðŸ”µ Blue indicates the doof is either opened now, or the microcontroller has rebooted and doesn't know the last time the door was opened.
